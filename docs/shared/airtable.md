# Working with Airtable

::: warning NOTE
The official Airtable documentation refers to the columns of a table as "fields". For convenience, we generally refer to these as columns.
:::

We use Airtable as the backing database for all of our applications. To start off, we recommend reading through [this section of the admin guide](../admin/README.md#airtable) which covers Airtable basics, how to interact via the UI, and an overview of our `PROD` base.

Here, we'll introduce how we interact with Airtable in terms of development. Specifically, we use helper functions as a wrapper API for the official Airtable client, generated by the [`airtable-schema-generator` package](https://github.com/aivantg/airtable-schema-generator).

::: danger
Updating the Airtable base configuration, or the "schema", (i.e creating/renaming/removing tables, adding/removing/renaming columns) is generally a **BREAKING CHANGE** - live apps will be UNUSABLE.

Also, because all three applications are backed by the same `PROD` Airtable base **and** use the schema-generator package, schema updates must always be made & deployed to **all applications**.

Details in the next section.
:::

## Making changes to the Airtable base(s)

The `airtable-schema-generator` package relies on the local `schema.js` matching that of the actual Airtable base it's referencing. Thus, the schema generator must be re-run whenever there are schema updates to keep the local files in sync.

When breaking changes are made, **schema updates must be merged and deployed** via an [over-the-air update](./deployingupdates.html#option-a-updating-ota) **_before_** the Airtable schema can actually be changed via the UI.

Generally speaking, it's best to create a new development branch with **solely** the schema updates because schema changes affect **all branches immediately**. Creating a separate PR for schema updates isolates those changes and is also good practice.

::: tip
The nice thing about having both `[DEV]` and `[PROD]` bases is that we can merge the schema updates, update the Airtable `[DEV]` base (i.e make table and column changes), merge associated code/feature updates, and test `master` locally (connected to `[DEV]`) before pushing the schema updates to `[PROD]` and then making the Airtable `[PROD]` base changes.

WARNING: Don't forget to update the `[PROD]` base once updates have been pushed!
:::

### Breaking changes

- **DELETING TABLES, RENAMING A TABLE**: Deleting any table will cause the app to break, as the table depends on all tables in some capacity or another.

- **CHANGING COLUMN TYPE**: can also cause the code to break, and one should look through how a particular column is used in the codebase before making such a change.

- **DELETING COLUMNS, RENAMING A COLUMN**: As all columns are used by the app at some point to access information, and changing column names, case etc. would break things.

::: tip
As you can tell, most changes are breaking. The only changes that aren't are **ADDING A TABLE** or **ADDING A COLUMN** to a table, since none of the live code attempts (and fails) to use information in the new column/table.

However, you **must** create a separate PR for the schema update and make sure it is merged **before** your new feature's PR is merged. Otherwise, the schema in `master` will be out of sync and your feature will not work as expected.

\*Updating the schema in the same PR is technically correct as well, but we'll lose the electronic trail of schema updates in the commit history.

## Airtable Schema Generator

The Airtable Schema Generator is a tool Blueprint developed alongside this web app (used by both our project and the [People Power project](https://github.com/calblueprint/peoplepower-web/)) that generates helper functions on top of the basic Airtable JavaScript client.

It generates these helper functions in accordance with the specified Airtable base's Schema. The full details on how it works, usage, as well as important caveats and all the settings available can be found on its [README](https://github.com/aivantg/airtable-schema-generator).

Here, we introduce briefly how it works and include details about how it is configured for our repositories.

### Overview

---

The schema generator outputs 4 files:

#### airtable.js

This file interacts directly with the Airtable JavaScript client and exposes the core [CRUD functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). It also contains the logic that translates the Airtable column names to JS-formatted names. "First Name" becomes "firstName", "Project Group" becomes "projectGroupId" (assuming it is a one-to-one relation field).

#### request.js

This file contains helper functions for every crud operation for every table. It's a convenience layer over airtable.js

#### schema.js

This file is a schema mapping that describes all the table and column names in a JS format. The app should never use this file directly, but it is necessary for `airtable.js` to translate records to JS-readable variable names. It should be used as a reference to know what a column name has been translated to.

#### schema.json

This is a JSON version of `schema.js` for reference.

---

### Writing code

The generated files use the `toAirtableFormat` / `fromAirtableFormat` to convert between table/column names in Airtable's format and table/column names in JavaScript-conventional `camelCase`. This is done implicitly (because `airtable.js` is a generated file), but if you look into `airtable.js` you will be able to see both these functions and their invocation in the different `airtable.js` CRUD calls.

These functions also do some other conversions (like converting `Announcements` to `announcementIds` for example), with the goal of making the naming more descriptive/explicit (in the above example, for instance, Announcements actually referred to an _array_ of announcements, which might be confusing).

To see these conversions explicitly, you can see the mapping from table/column names to their `camelCase` counterparts in `schema.js`. This is also the file that `toAirtableFormat` and `fromAirtableFormat` perform the conversion based on.

::: danger
The schema generator does not play nicely with plural-named tables; there are some special-cases in both our repos where the automatic pluralization/depluralization does not work properly. Thus, some variable names are misspelled when generated by the schema. **Always sanity-check `schema.js` if nothing else seems wrong and Airtable code is not working.**
:::

**What this means in development** is you must refer to table and column names in conventional JavaScript `camelCase` and in the format specified in `schema.js`. There should be plenty of examples to reference in the codebase. Referring to a table or column exactly as they are named in Airtable will **not** work.

::: tip
See [PR #48](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/pull/48) (customer) and [PR #10](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen-clerks/pull/10) (clerk) for when we first refactored the existing code to use the wrapper API.
:::

### Running the generator

::: tip
The generator does **not need to be run regularly**. Ideally, schema updates are few and far between (especially since they are often breaking!).
:::

_When you first clone the repos, you do **NOT** need to run the generator. The `lib/airtable/*.js` files have been generated and are already committed. There's no need to regenerate unless the schema changes._

The local schema files are (re)generated with the command `yarn generate-schema`. For convenience, all of our repos are configued to use the `auto-headless` mode so there is no user interaction required. Thus, you must fill in the `AIRTABLE_EMAIL` and `AIRTABLE_PASSWORD` sections of your local `.env.generator` file (customer/clerk repos) or `.env` file (node repo) to allow automated login on Airtable.

::: warning NOTE
These credentials are not saved anywhere other than your own computer. This allows the schema generator to automatically scrape your schema from Airtable. If you're curious about what happens when the generator code runs, change `auto-headless` in the schema generator's settings in package.json to `auto`.
:::

#### Post-generation modifications

Because the customer and clerk repos use a custom file to store and auto-switch environment variables between `[DEV]` and `[PROD]` instead of a traditional `.env` file, the schema generator doesn't know how to find the `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` or the `REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY` in `airtable.js`.

Thus, after regenerating the local files, you must copy this code into `airtable.js`.

```javascript
// Add import to the top of the file
import getEnvVars from '../../environment';

// Replace the following lines in `lib/airtable.js` (starting with this one)
const ENDPOINT_URL = 'https://api.airtable.com';

const { BASE_ID, AIRTABLE_API_KEY } = getEnvVars();

Airtable.configure({
  endpointUrl: ENDPOINT_URL,
  apiKey: AIRTABLE_API_KEY,
});

const base = Airtable.base(BASE_ID);
```

This code can also be found as a block comment in `environment.example`.

---

Note that the node repo's copy of `airtable.js` contains some custom helper functions, so the settings default to `overwrite: false`. The following only applies if it is set to `overwrite: true`.

The node repo uses the `dotenv-safe` package to locate environment variables.

Thus, after regenerating the files, you must add this line to `airtable.js` (we did so after the import lines):

```javascript
require('dotenv-safe').config({ allowEmptyValues: true });
```

### Configuration

The schema generator's settings live in `package.json`. For the most part, they do not need to be edited.

#### dccentralkitchen

```json
    "airtable-schema-generator": {
    "output": "lib/airtable",
    "mode": "auto-headless",
    "envFileName": ".env.generator",
    "schemaMeta": {
      "Customers": {
        "lookupFields": [
          "Phone Number"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

- `output`: where to output generated files
- `mode`: how to get the data from Airtable
- `envFileName`: in the customer and clerk repos, we use a different `env` file (`environment.js`), so we use a special `.env.generator` file for schema-generator-related environment variables.
- `schemaMeta` describes any extra helper functions we want to create. In this case, we want to create a helper function that allows us to look up `Customers` by their `Phone Number`. This extra function is then created in `request.js`.

#### dccentralkitchen-clerks

```json
    "airtable-schema-generator": {
    "output": "lib/airtable",
    "mode": "auto-headless",
    "envFileName": ".env.generator",
    "schemaMeta": {
      "Customers": {
        "lookupFields": [
          "Phone Number"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

- `output`: where to output generated files
- `mode`: how to get the data from Airtable
- `envFileName`: in the customer and clerk repos, we use a different `env` file (`environment.js`), so we use a special `.env.generator` file for schema-generator-related environment variables.
- `schemaMeta` describes any extra helper functions we want to create. In this case, we want to create a helper function that allows us to look up `Customers` by their `Phone Number`. This extra function is then created in `request.js`.

#### dccentralkitchen-node

```json
    "airtable-schema-generator": {
    "output": "lib/airtable",
    "mode": "auto-headless",
    "overwrite": "false",
    "schemaMeta": {
      "Stores": {
        "lookupFields": [
          "Store Name"
        ]
      },
      "Products": {
        "lookupFields": [
          "Full Name"
        ]
      }
    }
```

- `output`: where to output generated files
- `mode`: how to get the data from Airtable
- `overwrite` signifies that we do not want to overwrite `airtable.js`. This is set to `false` here only because in the Node.js app, we created some extra functions in `airtable.js` that the current version of the generator package doesn't have yet. However, if the schema generator package is updated, it's crucial to grab the latest version of `airtable.js` by setting this flag to `true` and re-running the generator.
- `schemaMeta` describes any extra helper functions we want to create. In this case, we want to create a helper function that allows us to look up `Stores` by their `Store Name` (similar for `Products`). This extra function is then created in `request.js`.

Note that this repo actually has multiple copies of the generated files - one per base (`lib/airtable`, `lib/airtable-prod`, `lib/airtable-test`). When you run the generator, you must **manually update `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` in `.env` and `output` in `package.json`** when updating the respective schemas.
