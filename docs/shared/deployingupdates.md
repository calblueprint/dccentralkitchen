# Deploying Updates

::: warning NOTE
This documentation is the same for both the customer and clerk applications.
:::

You can either deploy the update over-the-air (OTA) or submit a build a new version of the standalone app and re-submit to app stores.

**Jump to instructions:**

- [Option A. Updating over-the-air (OTA)](#option-a-updating-ota)
- [Option B. Submitting a new build](#option-b-submitting-a-new-build)

If you are unsure which method to use, carefully read the guidelines below.

## Updating OTA vs. submitting a new build

> Over-the-air (OTA) updates allow you to publish a new version of your app JavaScript and assets without building a new version of your standalone app and re-submitting to app stores.

::: rightlink
From [Expo Docs: Configuring OTA Updates](https://docs.expo.io/guides/configuring-ota-updates/)
:::

Not all updates can be submitted OTA. There are several limitations with OTA updates, including many changes in `app.json`. You can read more about the [limitations of OTA updates here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/publishing/#limitations). Additionally, rollout and adoption of OTA updates can be unreliable. Err on the side of caution when deciding whether to make an OTA update or submit a new build.

### When to [update OTA](#option-a-updating-ota)

- **Backwards-compatible bug fixes**: features where the app would remain usable for those with or without the latest update
  - ex. front-end additions with store details and store hours in [v1.1_tag_updates](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/releases/tag/v1.1_tag_updates)
- **Minor time-sensitive changes**
  - ex. Healthy Corners requested adding 500 bonus points for signing up to help the Nam's Market launch in [v1.2.0_signup_bonus](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/releases/tag/v1.2.0_signup_bonus), which also includes several visual bug fixes
- **Airtable schema updates**: breaking if not updated immediately. [More details here](./airtable.md#making-changes-to-the-airtable-base-s).

### When to [submit a new build](#option-b-submitting-a-new-build)

- **Backwards-incompatible breaking changes**
  - ex. all passwords had to be changed in Airtable for [#130 Implement basic encryption for passwords](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/pull/130). If users had not recieved the OTA update, they would not be able to access their accounts
- **Modifications in `expo.ios` or `expo.android` in `app.json`**

  - Learn more about specific limitations in the [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/publishing/#limitations)
  - ex. adding Firebase configuration in [#88 Firebase integration + Analytics](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/pull/88)

## Option A. Updating OTA

Over-the-air (OTA) updates allow you to publish a new version of your app JavaScript and assets without building a new version of your standalone app and re-submitting to app stores.

From [Expo Docs: Configuring OTA Updates](https://docs.expo.io/guides/configuring-ota-updates/)
:::

### Set up your release branch

1. Create a new branch from the most up-to-date version of master named `release` with the update version number using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines. For most updates, it is recommended to only increment the PATCH version.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release-1.1.2
   ```
2. Bump the `expo.version` number in **`app.json`** with the new SemVer version number.

   ```json {4}
   {
     "expo": {
       ...
       "version": "1.1.1", // would become "1.1.2"
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

### Publish with Expo

1. In your release branch, run `expo publish --release-channel prod`
2. Once the update finishes processing, the latest updates should appear within the app. If changes do not appear immediately, close and reopen the app.

Once the OTA update is successfully published, skip the next section and jump to [Merge release changes](#merge-release-changes).

## Option B. Submitting a new build

### Set up your release branch

1. Create a new branch from the most up-to-date version of master named `release` with the update version number using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release-1.1.0
   ```
2. Bump the following version numbers in **`app.json`**

   - Increment `version` and `buildNumber` based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines
   - `versionCode` must be an integer. Increment this for each release.

   ```json {4,8,13}
   {
     "expo": {
       ...
       "version": "1.0.1", // would become "1.1.0"
       ...
       "ios": {
         ...
         "buildNumber": "1.0.1", // would become "1.1.0"
         ...
         },
       "android": {
         ...
   			"versionCode": 2 // would become 3
       },
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

## Merge release changes

Once the update is successfully deployed, merge the release branch into `master` to update any hotfixes and version numbers.

## Track the Release in GitHub

It is easy to lose track of which changes are included with which updates, and whether those updates were delivered OTA or through new builds. Releases in Github are good for organizing and documenting releases.

### Tag the Release

1. In your release branch, mark the release point using a tag with the SemVer version code from `expo.version` in **`app.json`**

   ```bash
   $ git tag v1.2.0
   ```

   For updates where the version number does not change, note what the specific change is within the tag name.

   ```bash
   $ git tag v1.2.0_signup_bonus
   ```

2. Push the tag using `git push origin <tagname>`

   ```bash
    $ git push origin v1.2.0_signup_bonus
   ```

   More on [Git Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

### Create a Release from the tag

This is optional but highly recommended to track bigger releases including more major feature changes.

1. Go to the **Tags** within the **Releases** page in the [customer](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/tags) or [clerk](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen-clerks/tags) repo
2. Select the `•••` menu by the latest tag and select **Create release**
   ![Tag](../assets/appstoreupdate/release-git.png)
3. In **Release Title**, enter the SemVer code from `version` in **`app.json`**. In parentheses, add either **OTA** if the update was published OTA, or **build** if the update was published by a standalone build.
4. Add a description about the **Features & Improvements** and **Bug Fixes**.
