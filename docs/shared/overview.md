## Design

Go to the [design prototypes page](../design) (linked in the navbar) to see the Figma project, as well as various resources.

## Known Issues

We use GitHub's built-in issue tracker to track issues we are aware of (e.g [the customer repo](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen/issues)). Looking at open issues may be helpful when attempting to triage or fix bugs.

Additionally, we've done our best to document our work/thought process throughout development via the PR descriptions. We also used "Squash and merge" for almost all PRs, so running `git blame` from `master` and then inspecting the source PR(s) from a particular commit may be helpful as well.

## Navigating this site

Relevant documentation, including instructions for onboarding and setting up local environments, development lifecycle, etc can be found in the individual subpages:

- **[Customer](/customer)**

- **[Clerk](/clerk)**

- **[Backend](/node)**

The **Managing & Deploying Apps** section contains documentation that is shared between two or more of our repos.

[Future development](./future.md): Please take a look at this page when considering changes, new features, etc.

Navbar: For convenience, the `PROD` base, `DEV` base, and Airtable workspace are linked, as well as all three of the active GitHub repos.
