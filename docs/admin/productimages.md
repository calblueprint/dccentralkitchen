# Processing product images
Image files must be stored in Airtable at a reduced size in order for images to load efficiently in both apps.

These instructions go through how to process the images using <https://www.iloveimg.com/> to save images at standard dimensions with a reduced file size.

## Step 1. Resize the image(s)
1. Go to [this site](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image) and upload the product image(s).
   ::: warning
   To save time, you can upload multiple images at a time. However, you **must** upload all **.png**s separately from **.jpg**s in order to complete Step 2.
   :::
2. Under **Resize Options**, select **BY PIXELS** and enter **360px** under width. Make sure that only **Maintain aspect ratio** is selected.
