## What is Healthy Rewards?

**Healthy Rewards** is a program that encourages shoppers to purchase more fresh and healthy fruits and vegetables! 

Here's how it works: 

1. Customers **sign up** with their phone number
2. They **buy Healthy Corners products** at participating stores
3. For every every dollar spent on healthy products, they **earn 100 points**
4. When they reach **500 points**, they earn a **$5 reward** 
5. They can them **redeem rewards** on future healthy purchases

## Step 0: Combining with Store POS

::: warning NOTE
This app **does not replace** your store's current point of sale system! It is meant to be used with your store's system if a customer buys Healthy Corners products and is part of the Healthy Rewards program.

A checkout will work like this: 

1. Check if the customer purchased Healthy Corners products
2. Ask if they are part of Healthy Rewards. If so, open the app and enter their phone number
3. Checkout all their Healthy Corners products
4. Tap `Rewards` and let them know how many rewards they have and their subtotal/total
5. Ask how many rewards they would like to use and apply to sale. Confirm on app
6. Move to the store point of sale system and check out
7. **Apply the same amount of rewards/discounts** as you did on the app
8. End point of sale check out

This guide explains how the app process works!
